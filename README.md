<p>This is a web-based game app. The game has a logic of a popular board game called Scrabble. Here you try to form words from a random set of 8 letters.</p>
<p>Currently the app is using a list of about 83,000 English langauge words. This list serves as a validity check for the choices made the player and for finding the highest scoring words in a "computer mode".</p>
